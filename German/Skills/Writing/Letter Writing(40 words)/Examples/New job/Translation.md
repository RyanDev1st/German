Dear Klaus,

I hope you're doing well! I have wonderful news.

Since last week, I'm working at a new company. I'm now a project manager at Apple. My colleagues are very nice, and I really enjoy the work. The office is modern and has a nice cafeteria.

Let's go for coffee soon and talk more about it!

Best regards,
Michael
