Dear Sarah,

How are you? I went shopping in the city yesterday.

At the department store, I bought a beautiful blue dress. It was on sale and very affordable. I also found new black shoes. The shoes match perfectly with the dress.

Would you like to go shopping together next week?

Best regards,
Lisa
